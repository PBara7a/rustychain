# blockchain-sandbox

This blockchain is being built using a **Test Driven Development** approach. The testing framework used to support this was **Jest**.

What I have learned building this project:

- Blockchain fundamentals:
  - Why a harcoded genesis block is necessary
  - How blocks are 'linked' to form a chain
  - Chain validation and chain replacement
  - What are the roles of nonce and difficulty when mining a block
- Exposed me to different modules (crypto)
